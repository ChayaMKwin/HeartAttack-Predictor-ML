# HeartAttack-Predictor-ML
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart attacks using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes the Heart Attack Prediction dataset to train and evaluate different models.

## Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in prevention and treatment. This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict the occurrence of heart attacks based on various factors such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and more.

## Features
Loads and preprocesses the Heart Attack Prediction dataset
Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand correlations between features
Trains multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree
Evaluates model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports
